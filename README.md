# Unified-ML-Algorithms-Dashboard

This is a coursework project for the BSc course 'Machine Learning'. Here, several models and algorithms are implemented. This project is an interactive web application that demonstrates the predictions of various machine learning algorithms. It is built using Flask for the backend and HTML for the frontend, providing a user-friendly interface to visualize and interact with different ML models.

## ML Models

1. **Perceptron Learning Algorithm:** Implemented to classify apples and oranges based on input features.
2. **K-Means Clustering Algorithm:** Applied to two different datasets for clustering analysis:
   1. Scores of two variables.
   2. Student CGPA.
3. **DIS Algorithm:** Analyzed student CGPA for insights.
4. **KNN Algorithm:** Used for predicting T-shirt sizes based on given features.
